"PROJECT DISCRIPTION" : Project Overview : This project focuses on the automation of report generation using Python. The objective is to read structured data from a text file, perform basic analysis on it, and generate a PDF report. This project utilizes Python's core file-handling capabilities and leverages the FPDF library for PDF creation.


Objective of the Project:
Read data from a text file (e.g., student names and marks),
Process and analyze the data (e.g., calculate total students, average marks, highest and lowest scores),
Present the data and the analysis in a readable PDF report using Python.


Technologies Used:
Python 3.13 – Core programming language used.
FPDF (1.7.2) – A lightweight and easy-to-use library for PDF generation in Python.
Text Files (.txt) – Used for reading input data in CSV-like format.


Project Workflow:

Reading the Data:
The program begins by reading a .txt file (input.txt) containing structured information.
The first row is treated as the header (e.g., Name,Marks) and the remaining rows are treated as data

Analyzing the Data:
Once the data is read into a list, the program processes the numeric column (marks).

It calculates:
Total number of students, Average marks, Highest and lowest marks.

Generating the PDF:
The PDF report is created using the FPDF library. It includes:
A centered title at the top,
A table of all student names and marks,
Summary statistics,
The final report is exported as report.pdf.


Conclusion:
This project is a practical implementation of how Python can be used to automate routine documentation tasks. By integrating file I/O, basic data analysis, and PDF generation.
